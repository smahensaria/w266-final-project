[{'generated_text': "firecrackers and a chicken shaped firecracker sit on bricks and a bag of bricks. The brick cracker is a very strong firecracker, very powerful. He can also be used to blow on wooden walls: you can smash it through a wall or in pieces of a building.\n\nFirecracker's weakness is his weak spot on bricks, not the bricks behind him.\n\nThe player can only use the Brick Cracker. The bricks that the player must hit must fit inside him, but the player may hit other bricks even if he is near one of the pillars. If the player hits bricks which could be broken, the player may try and reattach the bricks, like from a crane.\n\nThe brick cracker can still be struck like a heavy tool. It can be pushed to blow on the floor, or thrown by the player with a ball.\n\nThe brick cracker attacks with a big, high impact fist.\n\nEven when not playing as a Brick Cracker, the player can use it to knock the floor or break the ceiling in a short period of time. You can then easily knock over the bricks which are not there. The brick cracker will not explode, but the player"},

 {'generated_text': 'firecrackers and a chicken shaped firecracker sit on bricks in front of our house next to the backyard fire pits in our yard as they burn. It was a fun day out for everyone and after we went down the stairs it became clear that the fire wasn\'t completely out of control until we reached the stairs on the south side of the building without any damage. However, our house wasn\'t really out of control until we came to the driveway and saw smoke from the building. That was it for this day and night at Cedar Hill. Our family continues to keep our house clean and our porch and dining room are always full of colorful things we love!\n\nI\'m in love with my home and I feel I have to say this: Cedar Hill is a place where you have to get out and visit and walk to just to hear stories about the amazing people and life that everyone here lives with. We are all here for what you want, that you like. And, if you\'d like to have fun with that "love" that you are all so thankful for, then Cedar Hill is the place. We enjoy this city all so much and have been fortunate to have our home and place grow on our shoulders.\n\nIn addition'},

 {'generated_text': "firecrackers and a chicken shaped firecracker sit on bricks facing the camera in an attempt to make it look like I'm the next target. The camera also gets a very close up view of the three suspects, who are wearing all black, and of course the one who is dressed very differently from the others. From what I'm seeing, they all have black clothing, all four have hats and a hood. I also see two male suspects wearing black and a white shirt and boots. The victim is the third man arrested.\n\nOne of the suspects also appears in the photo, presumably this man of Russian heritage. But I'm not sure what makes him different from the others, and that was more interesting. His background is dark and dark hair, the police description on the page clearly shows that he was a wealthy man of a certain kind, and had a bad personality. He was a member of the Soviet KGB and had a history of violence towards Russians. At the time he was working for an underground news outlet run by a guy called Boris Choly (he was actually an independent journalist working for a Russian news agency when he wasn't working here, so I wouldn't be too sure) who wanted to try to assassinate President Boris"}]
